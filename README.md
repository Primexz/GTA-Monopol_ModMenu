# GTA-Monopol_ModMenu

That's the source code of my old project: **Monopol**, an GTA 5 Cheat.


## This Repo includes
  - One of the best free mod menus of the GTA history
  - Custom Native Invoker
  - Many unique Sigs, Globals, Locals
  - Much unique features like namespoofer, ip grabber, ...
  - Very secure authentification based on my [X-Auth](https://github.com/Primexz/XAuth)


## The launcher
I will release the old version of the injector / launcher soon.
It includes:
- an license key system
  - temp licenses
  - permanent licenses
- dll injection
- modern UI

## Updating
The latest Monopol Update was on GTA 1.54, so you have to update following things to run it again:
  - Crossmap
  - Memory Signatures
  - Globals
  - Locals


## Big thanks to:
- pocakking
- Etienne
- Joel
- All of members of the old community

Its possible that R* patched some features, just try it. :)



Have Fun, Prime ðŸ’•
