# GTA-Monopol_ModMenu

That's the source code of my old project: **Monopol**, an GTA 5 Cheat.
The latest Monopol Update was on GTA 1.54, so you have to update following things to run it again:
  - Crossmap
  - Memory Signatures
  - Globals
  - Locals


Its possible that R* patched some features, just try it. :)




Have Fun, Prime ðŸ’•
